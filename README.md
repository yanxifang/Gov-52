# Gov 52: Models
### Spring 2021
### Yanxi Fang, Harvard University

This is my final project for Gov 52 - Models (Spring 2021), in which I attempt to replicate an existing published journal article.

I chose the article "Why Parties Displace Their Voters: Gentrification, Coalitional Change, and the Demise of Public Housing" by Winston Chou and Rafaela Dancygier, which will be published in Volume 115, Issue 2 of the *American Political Science Review* in May 2021 (the article was previously published online by Cambridge University Press on February 23, 2021).
